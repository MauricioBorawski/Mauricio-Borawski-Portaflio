# Welcome to my portafolio!

Hi! I am Mauricio a React developer located in Argentina.

## Aboout this project
This project started as a way to explore new frameworks, try new libriries and to work with new things like CI/CD, CSS animations, end to end tests and more!

## Technologies
- Astro
- Tailwind
- Typescript

## TODO List
In this section I will record the things that are left to complete or I would like to introduce to the source code.

[ ] CI/CD Pipelines.

[ ] Unit test and integration test.

[ ] End to end test with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
## FAQ
### Why [Astro](https://astro.build/) and not React?
Since this is a small project mainly focus to extend my resumen on a webpage with more interactivirility, use React would have been an overkill for this situation.

I love React for web applications but it was not very suitable for this project.
