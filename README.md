# Welcome to my [portfolio](https://portafolio-mauricioborawski.vercel.app/)!

Hi! I am Mauricio a React developer located in Argentina.

## About this project
This project started as a way to explore new frameworks, try new libraries, and to work with new things like CI/CD, CSS animations, end-to-end tests, and more!

## Technologies
- Astro
- Tailwind
- Typescript

## TODO List
In this section, I will record the things left to complete or that I would like to introduce to the source code.

[] CI/CD Pipelines.

[] Unit test and integration test.

[] End-to-end test with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
## FAQ
### Why [Astro](https://astro.build/) and not React?
Since this project mainly focuses on extending my resume on a webpage with more interactivity, using React would have been an overkill for this situation.

I love React for web applications but it was unsuitable for this project.
